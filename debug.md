# E-commerce AI Agent Debug Log

## Environment Setup and Dependencies

1. Initial dependencies installation:
   - Successfully installed required packages from requirements.txt
   - Additional packages installed:
     - `limits` (required by slowapi)
     - `seaborn` (for visualization)

2. Environment configuration:
   - Created `.env` file with necessary API keys and settings
   - Set up database path, API settings, and feature flags

## Data Loading

Successfully loaded the following CSV files into SQLite tables:

1. `csv/ad_sales.csv`
   - Table name: ad_sales
   - Rows loaded: 3,696

2. `csv/total_sales.csv`
   - Table name: total_sales
   - Rows loaded: 702

3. `csv/eligibility.csv`
   - Table name: eligibility
   - Rows loaded: 4,381

## Server Initialization

- Server successfully started on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- FastAPI application startup complete
- Rate limiting middleware configured
- CORS middleware enabled

## Issues Fixed During Setup

1. Fixed f-string syntax error in `db/loader.py`:
   - Issue: f-string expression contained backslashes
   - Solution: Reformatted SQL CREATE TABLE statement without line breaks

2. Resolved missing dependencies:
   - Added `limits` package for rate limiting functionality
   - Added `seaborn` package for visualization styling

3. Fixed matplotlib style configuration:
   - Issue: 'seaborn' style not found
   - Solution: Updated to use 'seaborn-v0_8' style

## Current Status

- Database connection: ✅ Working
- CSV data loading: ✅ Working
- Server startup: ✅ Working
- API endpoints: Ready for testing

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Test API endpoints:
   - Health check endpoint
   - Question answering endpoint
   - CSV upload endpoint

2. Test SQL generation:
   - Simple queries
   - Complex queries
   - Error handling

3. Test visualization:
   - Bar charts
   - Line charts
   - Pie charts

4. Test rate limiting:
   - Verify request limits
   - Check timeout behavior

5. Test streaming responses:
   - Verify chunked responses
   - Check timeout handling
